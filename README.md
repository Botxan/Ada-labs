# Ada-labs
Ada laboratories that I have been working in 1st course of IT Engineering.

A set of programs mostly written in Ada and a bit of Python and C, aimed to learn programming fundamentals.

Among all laboratories you can find programs related with:
* Procedure and function specification
* Type system
* User input output
* Character sequences
* Arrays
* Static and dynamic lists
* ...
